Kodular Creator provides one of the most complete tools in Internet to create apps without coding, and moreover it is being used by tons of students all over the world. Everybody has to be able to make their idea reality independently of their income . Someone can have the next big revolutionary idea , but sometimes without money it cannot be done . We don \u2019 t want this to happen . Also , as you might know , we take a small commission from AdMob components . What is fairer ? Getting a fixed quota from everyone , without taking into account if they earn something , or taking the proportional earnings people make with our platform ? I think the answer is very obvious . We do not earn nothing from people which doesn \u2019 t earn anything with our platform . And we only earn from people who monetize their apps , earning money with Kodular Creator .

We do not force nobody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings. The components we take commissions from are only AdMob ones ( AdMob Banner , AdMob Interstitial and AdMob Rewarded Video ). The other ones are free of commissions. The percentage of your earnings we take varies from a basic 5% up to a 20% , depending on the number of features you use in your app. For example, if an app with AdMob Ads is very simple, we will only take the 5% of those earnings . But if the app uses all our components and features, the commission will be of 20% . You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. We take it automatically from your AdMob & AdSense earnings, reducing your work. Premium Plan \u00b6 Since time ago , we have said that Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan .

Clicking the blue plus sign will allow you to add additional items to your list. add items to list \u00b6 Adds the given items to the end of the list. The difference between this and append to list is that append to list takes the items to be appended as a single list while add items to list takes the items as individual arguments. This block is a mutator . is in list? \u00b6 If thing is one of the elements of the list, returns true; otherwise, returns false. Note that if a list contains sublists, the members of the sublists are not themselves members of the list.

Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. Items are separated by commas. For example, converting the list (a b c d) to a CSV row produces (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"). The returned row text does not have a line separator at the end. list from csv row \u00b6 Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted row to produce a list of fields. For example, converting (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\") to a list produces (a b c d). list to csv table \u00b6 Interprets the list as a table in row-major format and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the table. Each item in the list should itself be a list representing a row of the CSV table. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. In the returned text, items in rows are separated by commas and rows are separated by CRLF (\\r\\n). list from csv table \u00b6 Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted table to produce a list of rows, each of which is a list of fields. Rows can be separated by newlines (\\n) or CRLF (\\r\\n). lookup in pairs \u00b6 Used for looking up information in a dictionary-like structure represented as a list. This operation takes three inputs, a key , a list pairs , and a notFound result, which by default, is set to \"not found\". Here pairs must be a list of pairs, that is, a list where each element is itself a list of two elements. Lookup in pairs finds the first pair in the list whose first element is the key, and returns the second element. For example, if the list is ((a apple) (d dragon) (b boxcar) (cat 100)) then looking up 'b' will return 'boxcar'. If there is no such pair in the list, then the_lookup in pairs_will return the notFound result.

Double clicking on the \"0\" in the block will allow you to change the number. = \u00b6 Tests whether two numbers are equal and returns true or false. \u2260 \u00b6 Tests whether two numbers are not equal and returns true or false. > \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is greater than the second number and returns true or false. \u2265 \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number and returns true or false. < \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is less than the second number and returns true or false. \u2264 \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number and returns true or false. + \u00b6 Returns the result of adding any amount of blocks that have a number value together. Blocks with a number value include the basic number block, length of list or text, variables with a number value, etc. This block is a mutator and can be expanded to allow more numbers in the sum. - \u00b6 Returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first. x \u00b6 Returns the result of multiplying any amount of blocks that have a number value together. It is a mutator block and can be expanded to allow more numbers in the product. / \u00b6 Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. ^ \u00b6 Returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second. Bitwise And \u00b6 Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits. Each bit of the result is 1 only if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. Bitwise Or (Inclusive) \u00b6 Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits. Each bit of the result is 1 if either of the corresponding bits in each operand is 1. Bitwise Or (Exclusive) \u00b6 Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits.

You can generate the same sequence of random numbers by first calling random set seed with the same value. This is useful for testing programs that involve random values. min \u00b6 Returns the smallest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, min will also consider 0 in its set of numbers. This block is a mutator and a dropdown. max \u00b6 Returns the largest value of a set of numbers.

If the fractional part is < .5 it will be rounded down. It it is > .5 it will be rounded up. If it is exactly equal to .5, numbers with an even whole part will be rounded down, and numbers with an odd whole part will be rounded up. (This method is called round to even .) ceiling \u00b6 Returns the smallest integer that's greater than or equal to the given number. floor \u00b6 Returns the greatest integer that's less than or equal to the given number. modulo \u00b6 Modulo(a,b) is the same as remainder(a,b) when a and b are positive. More generally, modulo(a,b) is defined for any a and b so that (floor(a/b)\u00d7 b) + modulo(a,b) = a. For example, modulo(11, 5) = 1, modulo(-11, 5) = 4, modulo(11, -5) = -4, modulo(-11, -5) = -1. Modulo(a,b) always has the same sign as b, while remainder(a,b) always has the same sign as a. remainder \u00b6 Remainder(a,b) returns the result of dividing a by b and taking the remainder. The remainder is the fractional part of the result multiplied by b. For example, remainder(11,5) = 1 because In this case, is the fractional part. We multiply this by b, in this case 5 and we get 1, our remainder. Other examples are remainder(-11, 5) = -1, remainder(11, -5) = 1, and remainder(-11, -5) = -1. quotient \u00b6 Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second and discarding any fractional part of the result. sin \u00b6 Returns the sine of the given number in degrees. cos \u00b6 Returns the cosine of the given number in degrees. tan \u00b6 Returns the tangent of the given number in degrees. asin \u00b6 Returns the arcsine of the given number in degrees. acos \u00b6 Returns the arccosine of the given number in degrees. atan \u00b6 Returns the arctangent of the given number in degrees. atan2 \u00b6 Returns the arctangent of y/x, given y and x. convert radians to degrees \u00b6 Returns the value in degrees of the given number in radians. The result will be an angle in the range [0, 360) convert degrees to radians \u00b6 Returns the value in radians of the given number in degrees.

The number of places must be a non-negative integer. The result is produced by rounding the number (if there were too many places) or by adding zeros on the right (if there were too few). is a number \u00b6 Returns true if the given object is a number, and false otherwise. convert number \u00b6 Takes a text string that represents a positive integer in one base and returns a string that represents the same number is another base. For example, if the input string is 10, then converting from base 10 to binary will produce the string 1010; while if the input string is the same 10, then converting from binary to base 10 will produce the string 2. If the input string is the same 10, then converting from base 10 to hex will produce the string A.","title":"Math"},{"location":"blocks/math/#math","text":"Note : any Math blocks that have unplugged sockets will read the unplugged spot as a 0. 0 (basic number block) = \u2260 > \u2265 < \u2264 + - x / ^ bitwise and bitwise or (inclusive) bitwise or (exclusive) random integer random fraction random set seed to min max square root absolute neg log e^ round ceiling floor modulo remainder quotient sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 convert radians to degrees convert degrees to radians format as a decimal is a number convert number","title":"Math"},{"location":"blocks/math/#cant-find-the-math-block-youre-looking-for-in-the-built-in-blocks","text":"Some math blocks are dropdowns which means that they can be converted into different blocks.

The Component 's behaviour is configured using Blocks Components + Blocks = Your Awesome App! What are Components ? \u00b6 Components are the basic building elements of any app in Kodular. Everything in the app is done with the help of one component or the other. Different components are used for different purposes. One component may be used to design the User Interface(UI) of the app, for example a Button component, while others may be used for performing actions like communicating to a database, saving an image to the Android device's folder etc. for example the FirebaseDB component. What are Blocks ? \u00b6 Blocks are ones which are used describe how to do a task. The way in which the Components respond to various actions and events in the app is designed using the Blocks . For example, how the app should respond when a Button is clicked, what data is to be communicated to the database using FirebaseDB component etc. are all configured using the Blocks . Thus, by using the various Components and by configuring its behaviour and response to actions from the user with the help of Blocks , an app is \"koded\" in Kodular. The Car Analogy \u00b6 Let us consider an analogy of a Car to better understand the concept of the components and blocks. A Car is constructed using various parts, like wheels, doors, engine, steering etc. each performing its own unique function. Some of these parts are visible to the driver(who is the user of the car) and he interacts with them directly, while some of them are not visible. And these parts know what their function is and how to perform it, for example, the function of the wheel is to provide support and move the car, the function of the steering wheel is to help streer the car and so on. An Android app is like the Car. Like how a car has various parts, an app is constructed using various Components , like Button, Label, File etc. with each component being used for a particular purpose. Like the parts of the Car, some of these Components are visible to the user of the app and they interact with it, while some of the components don't interact directly with the user. The behaviour or the purpose of these components are configured using the Blocks . The \"how to perform the function of a component\" part is configured by using the Blocks . Types of Components \u00b6 Visible Components : The components that can be viewed in the Viewer panel of the Designer page are known as Visible Component. They are visible to the user in the app and the user can interact with it directly and help in building the User Interface of the app. Non-Visible Components : The components that are not viewed in the Viewer panel of the Designer page are known as Non-Visible Component. They are the components that usually do other things like saving a file to the device's storage, getting data from various sensors of the device etc. But, sometimes, these components may also be used to create visible elements in the app. For example, the Notifier component, which is a Non-visible Component can be used to create a dialog which is visible on the device's screen. Types of Blocks of components \u00b6 Each Component has its own set of blocks, divided into three types: Property blocks Method blocks Event blocks Property Blocks \u00b6 Each component comes with its own set of Properties , which describe its characteristics. For example, the Button component has properties like Background Color, Text Color, Text Font Size etc. which are characteristics that describe the features of that particular button. Some these Properties can either be set from Designer page, or through Blocks , while some can be set only through Blocks and some only from the Designer . The Setter and Getter block for the Background Color property of a button. At any time in the app, the given property of a component can be read through a Getter Block . It gives the current value of that property of that particular component . Similarly, the given property of a component can be modified during the runtime of the app thorugh Setter Blocks . The Property blocks are Green in color. Info Not all the properties of the component have both Getter and Setter Blocks. Some of them may have only Getter or sometimes only Setter blocks. Method Blocks \u00b6 Methods are certain functions that a component can do. For example, the Sound component should be able to play the music when required. This is done by using a Method called Play , which instructs the components to carry out the task of playing the music. So, Methods are nothing but an instruction to carry out a particular task, like playing the music. Some methods require some additional data, which will also be used in carrying out that task. For example, Firebase DB component stores the data using a method called Store Value . But how will the component know what data to store and under what name ? This is where Parameters or simply Params are used. The Store Value methods has takes two parameters (i.e it makes use of two different data that need to be specified) namely tag and value To Store . So this method can be called (i.e used in the blocks) along with the two data that it needs like shown below. The Method to store data in the Firebase DB. Event Blocks \u00b6 Kodular apps are \"koded\" in an event-driven approach. That is, the blocks or behaviour of the app is executed based on the various events that occur. There is a wide range of events that occur thorughout the time for which the app is running, and the response of the app to these events can be configured. For example, the user clicking a Button , the app starting are all events. The response of the app to such events are configured by grouping the desired behaviour under the Event block. The methods and property blocks grouped under each event are executed whenever that particular event occurs. Let us take an example. If you want to change the Button text when the user clicks it, you have to group the logic to change the text under the Button.Clicked event. This is shown below. The Event block for changing button text when clicked.

It gives the current value of that property of that particular component . Similarly, the given property of a component can be modified during the runtime of the app thorugh Setter Blocks . The Property blocks are Green in color. Info Not all the properties of the component have both Getter and Setter Blocks. Some of them may have only Getter or sometimes only Setter blocks.","title":"Property Blocks"},{"location":"guides/#method-blocks","text":"Methods are certain functions that a component can do. For example, the Sound component should be able to play the music when required. This is done by using a Method called Play , which instructs the components to carry out the task of playing the music. So, Methods are nothing but an instruction to carry out a particular task, like playing the music. Some methods require some additional data, which will also be used in carrying out that task. For example, Firebase DB component stores the data using a method called Store Value . But how will the component know what data to store and under what name ? This is where Parameters or simply Params are used. The Store Value methods has takes two parameters (i.e it makes use of two different data that need to be specified) namely tag and value To Store . So this method can be called (i.e used in the blocks) along with the two data that it needs like shown below. The Method to store data in the Firebase DB.","title":"Method Blocks"},{"location":"guides/#event-blocks","text":"Kodular apps are \"koded\" in an event-driven approach. That is, the blocks or behaviour of the app is executed based on the various events that occur. There is a wide range of events that occur thorughout the time for which the app is running, and the response of the app to these events can be configured. For example, the user clicking a Button , the app starting are all events. The response of the app to such events are configured by grouping the desired behaviour under the Event block. The methods and property blocks grouped under each event are executed whenever that particular event occurs. Let us take an example. If you want to change the Button text when the user clicks it, you have to group the logic to change the text under the Button.Clicked event. This is shown below. The Event block for changing button text when clicked.

In this tutorial, you will learn to create your first app with Kodular. If you have any queries or doubts, feel free reach out to us on the community . The first steps \u00b6 Navigate to Kodular Creator . You will be presented with a Login screen. Login to continue. Then after that you will be taken to the Projects screen. A Project is nothing but an app. Click on + New Project button to create a Project . You can enter any name you want. In this tutorial, we will name the app HelloKodular . Click Next . The project will be created and you will be taken to the Designer page of your project. For testing your app while developing, please see Live Development . Tip At this point, we recommend going through the Understanding Kodular page to get an overview of developing apps in Kodular. The User Interface of Kodular Creator \u00b6 First, let us walk thorough the Designer UI of Kodular Creator. The above shown screen is called Designer . From this page, you can add/delete Components and modify their properties. On the left side of your page, numbered 1 is the Components Palette or simply Palette . This consists of various components grouped under different categories. When you need to add a component, you can click on the component on the Palette , hold it and drag it onto the Viewer area of the Designer page. On the right side, you have the Components Hierarchy and the Designer Properties Panel (which is visible when you select a component ). The Components Hierarchy shows the visible components added into the current project . The Designer Properties Panel will be visible when clicking on a component and displays the properties of that component. In the middle is the Viewer which gives a mocked up view of the app as seen on a real device. To add a component to the project , drag the component from the Palette and drop it inside the Viewer . Below the Viewer , the Non-visible Components Panel is present, which shows all the Non-Visible Components added to the current project . At the top of the page, various menus and options are present. Building the app \u00b6 Now that we are familiar with the interface, we can get to work and create a simple app, with a Button which shows the text \"Hello World\". Step 1 Find the Button component from the Palette under the User Interface category. Click on it, and drag it onto the Viewer , while keeping the mouse button clicked down. This is how you add a component to the project. Step 2 Now click on the Button1 displayed on the Components Hierarchy . By default, this is how the components are named, you can rename them if needed. The Properties Panel for the Button should be visible now. Step 3 Now, find the Text property in that panel and change that to Hello World! . If you have connected your companion and testing using it, then now the change should be reflected on the device. Step 4 Now, you can select Export menu from the top menubar to build your project into an APK, which can be installed in an Android device. Step 5 Once the APK is built, the APK will either be downloaded onto your computer, or the barcode to the link will be shown based on the option you chose.
