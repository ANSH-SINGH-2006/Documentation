Kodular is FREE ! Kodular Creator is completely free of charge . You can use it for whatever you want, and we will never ask you to pay us for its usage . We wanted it like that so anyone could convert their desired ideas into apps in a simple way. We think that everybody should have the right to create apps even without knowing how to code . That is why our platform is free and it will remain like that forever . This also extends to Kodular Store and Kodular Extensions IDE . Why this business model? Kodular was created to providen accessible suite for everyone to learn and, later, professionally create apps. Due to this, we strongly believe learning to code has to be a right and nobody should have to pay in order to learn the basics of programming. Kodular Creator provides one of the most complete tools in Internet to create apps without coding, and moreover it is being used by tons of students all over the world. Everybody has to be able to make their idea reality independently of their income. Someone can have the next big revolutionary idea, but sometimes without money it cannot be done. We don\u2019t want this to happen. What is fairer? Getting a fixed quota from everyone, without taking into account if they earn something, or taking the proportional earnings people make with our platform? We think the answer is very obvious. We do not earn nothing from people which doesn\u2019t earn anything with our platform. And we only earn from people who monetize their apps, earning money with Kodular Creator. Commissions \u00b6 Updated: 19 January 2019 - 02 May 2019 Due to some technical issues with Google, apps generated with Kodular Creator Versions from Draco 1.3.1 to 1.3B.4, both included, will be free of comission. We will update this page as soon as it gets fixed. However, to keep our services for free, we take a small comission from your earnings in ads . We do not force nobody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings. The components we take commissions from are only Interstitial ones. The other ones are free of commissions. Interstitial ads are the top performing ad types. The percentage of your earnings we take starts from a basic 5% , and increases depending on the number of components and features you use in your app. For example, if an app is very simple, we will only take the 5% of those earnings . But if the app uses all our components and features, the commission will be increased . You can calculate the final commission using this app . You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. We take it automatically using something called \"fallback ads\". Find more information about this here . Premium Plan \u00b6 Since time ago , we have said that Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan . This also extends to Kodular Store . But the Extensions IDE will have a Premium Plan . Currently available features will not disappear or will not reduce its features . We will only develop new features for the Premium Plan, for example removing the waiting queue or uploading custom libraries .","title":"Pricing"},{"location":"pricing/#pricing","text":"How much does it cost?

Clicking the blue plus sign will allow you to add additional items to your list. add items to list \u00b6 Adds the given items to the end of the list. The difference between this and append to list is that append to list takes the items to be appended as a single list while add items to list takes the items as individual arguments. This block is a mutator . is in list? \u00b6 If thing is one of the elements of the list, returns true; otherwise, returns false. Note that if a list contains sublists, the members of the sublists are not themselves members of the list.

Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. Items are separated by commas. For example, converting the list (a b c d) to a CSV row produces (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"). The returned row text does not have a line separator at the end. list from csv row \u00b6 Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted row to produce a list of fields. For example, converting (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\") to a list produces (a b c d). list to csv table \u00b6 Interprets the list as a table in row-major format and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the table. Each item in the list should itself be a list representing a row of the CSV table. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. In the returned text, items in rows are separated by commas and rows are separated by CRLF (\\r\\n). list from csv table \u00b6 Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted table to produce a list of rows, each of which is a list of fields. Rows can be separated by newlines (\\n) or CRLF (\\r\\n). lookup in pairs \u00b6 Used for looking up information in a dictionary-like structure represented as a list. This operation takes three inputs, a key , a list pairs , and a notFound result, which by default, is set to \"not found\". Here pairs must be a list of pairs, that is, a list where each element is itself a list of two elements. Lookup in pairs finds the first pair in the list whose first element is the key, and returns the second element. For example, if the list is ((a apple) (d dragon) (b boxcar) (cat 100)) then looking up 'b' will return 'boxcar'. If there is no such pair in the list, then the_lookup in pairs_will return the notFound result.

Double clicking on the \"0\" in the block will allow you to change the number. = \u00b6 Tests whether two numbers are equal and returns true or false. \u2260 \u00b6 Tests whether two numbers are not equal and returns true or false. > \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is greater than the second number and returns true or false. \u2265 \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number and returns true or false. < \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is less than the second number and returns true or false. \u2264 \u00b6 Tests whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number and returns true or false. + \u00b6 Returns the result of adding any amount of blocks that have a number value together. Blocks with a number value include the basic number block, length of list or text, variables with a number value, etc. This block is a mutator and can be expanded to allow more numbers in the sum. - \u00b6 Returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first. x \u00b6 Returns the result of multiplying any amount of blocks that have a number value together. It is a mutator block and can be expanded to allow more numbers in the product. / \u00b6 Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. ^ \u00b6 Returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second. Bitwise And \u00b6 Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits. Each bit of the result is 1 only if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. Bitwise Or (Inclusive) \u00b6 Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits. Each bit of the result is 1 if either of the corresponding bits in each operand is 1. Bitwise Or (Exclusive) \u00b6 Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits.

You can generate the same sequence of random numbers by first calling random set seed with the same value. This is useful for testing programs that involve random values. min \u00b6 Returns the smallest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, min will also consider 0 in its set of numbers. This block is a mutator and a dropdown. max \u00b6 Returns the largest value of a set of numbers.

If the fractional part is < .5 it will be rounded down. It it is > .5 it will be rounded up. If it is exactly equal to .5, numbers with an even whole part will be rounded down, and numbers with an odd whole part will be rounded up. (This method is called round to even .) ceiling \u00b6 Returns the smallest integer that's greater than or equal to the given number. floor \u00b6 Returns the greatest integer that's less than or equal to the given number. modulo \u00b6 Modulo(a,b) is the same as remainder(a,b) when a and b are positive. More generally, modulo(a,b) is defined for any a and b so that (floor(a/b)\u00d7 b) + modulo(a,b) = a. For example, modulo(11, 5) = 1, modulo(-11, 5) = 4, modulo(11, -5) = -4, modulo(-11, -5) = -1. Modulo(a,b) always has the same sign as b, while remainder(a,b) always has the same sign as a. remainder \u00b6 Remainder(a,b) returns the result of dividing a by b and taking the remainder. The remainder is the fractional part of the result multiplied by b. For example, remainder(11,5) = 1 because In this case, is the fractional part. We multiply this by b, in this case 5 and we get 1, our remainder. Other examples are remainder(-11, 5) = -1, remainder(11, -5) = 1, and remainder(-11, -5) = -1. quotient \u00b6 Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second and discarding any fractional part of the result. sin \u00b6 Returns the sine of the given number in degrees. cos \u00b6 Returns the cosine of the given number in degrees. tan \u00b6 Returns the tangent of the given number in degrees. asin \u00b6 Returns the arcsine of the given number in degrees. acos \u00b6 Returns the arccosine of the given number in degrees. atan \u00b6 Returns the arctangent of the given number in degrees. atan2 \u00b6 Returns the arctangent of y/x, given y and x. convert radians to degrees \u00b6 Returns the value in degrees of the given number in radians. The result will be an angle in the range [0, 360) convert degrees to radians \u00b6 Returns the value in radians of the given number in degrees.

The number of places must be a non-negative integer. The result is produced by rounding the number (if there were too many places) or by adding zeros on the right (if there were too few). is a number \u00b6 Returns true if the given object is a number, and false otherwise. convert number \u00b6 Takes a text string that represents a positive integer in one base and returns a string that represents the same number is another base. For example, if the input string is 10, then converting from base 10 to binary will produce the string 1010; while if the input string is the same 10, then converting from binary to base 10 will produce the string 2. If the input string is the same 10, then converting from base 10 to hex will produce the string A.","title":"Math"},{"location":"blocks/math/#math","text":"Note : any Math blocks that have unplugged sockets will read the unplugged spot as a 0. 0 (basic number block) = \u2260 > \u2265 < \u2264 + - x / ^ bitwise and bitwise or (inclusive) bitwise or (exclusive) random integer random fraction random set seed to min max square root absolute neg log e^ round ceiling floor modulo remainder quotient sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 convert radians to degrees convert degrees to radians format as a decimal is a number convert number","title":"Math"},{"location":"blocks/math/#cant-find-the-math-block-youre-looking-for-in-the-built-in-blocks","text":"Some math blocks are dropdowns which means that they can be converted into different blocks.

This component can be used to detect some of the motions that occur on the physical device, such as shaking, tilting etc. Properties \u00b6 Available \u00b6 ( Getter only ) ( Blocks only ) Type: Boolean Gives whether the accelerometer sensor is available on the device or not. Some devices may not have this sensor and thus, before working with this sensor, it is better to check if the sensor is available for use using this block. Enabled \u00b6 ( Getter + Setter ) Type: Boolean Determines whether the Accelerometer is enabled or not. A disabled component does not execute any of the Events . It does not respond to any interactions with it by the user. Options true The Accelerometer is enabled and will execute Events when they occur. false The Accelerometer is disabled and will not execute Events when they occur. Minimum Interval \u00b6 ( Getter + Setter ) Type: Number Specifies the minimum interval in milliseconds, between two consecutive phone shakes.(detected using Shaking event) Sensitivity \u00b6 ( Getter + Setter ) Type: Number Specifies how sensitive the accelerometer sensor is when measuring the values. Options 1 Weak sensitivity 2 Moderate sensitivity 3 Strong sensitivity XAccel \u00b6 ( Getter only ) ( Blocks only ) Type: Number Gives the acceleration along the x-axis. See the description of Acceleration Changed event for more info. YAccel \u00b6 ( Getter only ) ( Blocks only ) Type: Number Gives the acceleration along the y-axis. See the description of Acceleration Changed event for more info. ZAccel \u00b6 ( Getter only ) ( Blocks only ) Type: Number Gives the acceleration along the z-axis. See the description of Acceleration Changed event for more info. Legacy Mode \u00b6 ( Designer Only ) Type: Boolean Prior to the release that added this property the AccelerometerSensor component passed through sensor values directly as received from the Android system. However these values do not compensate for tablets that default to Landscape mode. With this property set to false , the values you receive in the compensated, corrected values. It is recommeneded that you work with the property set to false in newer apps, as this was added only to keep the older projects backward-compatible. Methods \u00b6 Accelerometer sensor component has no Methods . Events \u00b6 Acceleration Changed \u00b6 ( Number xAccel Number yAccel Number zAccel ) Indicates the acceleration changed in the X, Y, and/or Z dimensions. Params xAccel Number: Gives the acceleration along x-axis. The value is 0 when the phone is at rest on a flat surface, positive when the phone is tilted to the right (i.e., its left side is raised), and negative when the phone is tilted to the left (i.e., its right size is raised). yAccel Number: Gives the acceleration along x-axis. The value is 0 when the phone is at rest on a flat surface, positive when its bottom is raised, and negative when its top is raised. zAccel Number: Gives the acceleration along x-axis. The value is equal to -9.8 (earth's gravity in meters per second per second when the device is at rest parallel to the ground with the display facing up, 0 when perpendicular to the ground, and +9.8 when facing down. The value can also be affected by accelerating it with or against gravity. Shaking \u00b6 ( None ) Indicates the device started being shaken or continues to be shaken.","title":"Accelerometer"},{"location":"components/sensors/accelerometer/#accelerometer-sensor","text":"","title":"Accelerometer Sensor"},{"location":"components/sensors/accelerometer/#overview","text":"Accelerometer Sensor componenent is used to read the values from the Accelerometer sensor of the mobile device.

The Component 's behaviour is configured using Blocks Components + Blocks = Your Awesome App! What are Components ? \u00b6 Components are the basic building elements of any app in Kodular. Everything in the app is done with the help of one component or the other. Different components are used for different purposes. One component may be used to design the User Interface(UI) of the app, for example a Button component, while others may be used for performing actions like communicating to a database, saving an image to the Android device's folder etc. for example the FirebaseDB component. What are Blocks ? \u00b6 Blocks are ones which are used describe how to do a task. The way in which the Components respond to various actions and events in the app is designed using the Blocks . For example, how the app should respond when a Button is clicked, what data is to be communicated to the database using FirebaseDB component etc. are all configured using the Blocks . Thus, by using the various Components and by configuring its behaviour and response to actions from the user with the help of Blocks , an app is \"koded\" in Kodular. The Car Analogy \u00b6 Let us consider an analogy of a Car to better understand the concept of the components and blocks. A Car is constructed using various parts, like wheels, doors, engine, steering etc. each performing its own unique function. Some of these parts are visible to the driver(who is the user of the car) and he interacts with them directly, while some of them are not visible. And these parts know what their function is and how to perform it, for example, the function of the wheel is to provide support and move the car, the function of the steering wheel is to help streer the car and so on. An Android app is like the Car. Like how a car has various parts, an app is constructed using various Components , like Button, Label, File etc. with each component being used for a particular purpose. Like the parts of the Car, some of these Components are visible to the user of the app and they interact with it, while some of the components don't interact directly with the user. The behaviour or the purpose of these components are configured using the Blocks . The \"how to perform the function of a component\" part is configured by using the Blocks . Types of Components \u00b6 Visible Components : The components that can be viewed in the Viewer panel of the Designer page are known as Visible Component. They are visible to the user in the app and the user can interact with it directly and help in building the User Interface of the app. Non-Visible Components : The components that are not viewed in the Viewer panel of the Designer page are known as Non-Visible Component. They are the components that usually do other things like saving a file to the device's storage, getting data from various sensors of the device etc. But, sometimes, these components may also be used to create visible elements in the app. For example, the Notifier component, which is a Non-visible Component can be used to create a dialog which is visible on the device's screen. Types of Blocks of components \u00b6 Each Component has its own set of blocks, divided into three types: Property blocks Method blocks Event blocks Property Blocks \u00b6 Each component comes with its own set of Properties , which describe its characteristics. For example, the Button component has properties like Background Color, Text Color, Text Font Size etc. which are characteristics that describe the features of that particular button. Some these Properties can either be set from Designer page, or through Blocks , while some can be set only through Blocks and some only from the Designer . The Setter and Getter block for the Background Color property of a button. At any time in the app, the given property of a component can be read through a Getter Block . It gives the current value of that property of that particular component . Similarly, the given property of a component can be modified during the runtime of the app thorugh Setter Blocks . The Property blocks are Green in color. Info Not all the properties of the component have both Getter and Setter Blocks. Some of them may have only Getter or sometimes only Setter blocks. Method Blocks \u00b6 Methods are certain functions that a component can do. For example, the Sound component should be able to play the music when required. This is done by using a Method called Play , which instructs the components to carry out the task of playing the music. So, Methods are nothing but an instruction to carry out a particular task, like playing the music. Some methods require some additional data, which will also be used in carrying out that task. For example, Firebase DB component stores the data using a method called Store Value . But how will the component know what data to store and under what name ? This is where Parameters or simply Params are used. The Store Value methods has takes two parameters (i.e it makes use of two different data that need to be specified) namely tag and value To Store . So this method can be called (i.e used in the blocks) along with the two data that it needs like shown below. The Method to store data in the Firebase DB. Event Blocks \u00b6 Kodular apps are \"koded\" in an event-driven approach. That is, the blocks or behaviour of the app is executed based on the various events that occur. There is a wide range of events that occur thorughout the time for which the app is running, and the response of the app to these events can be configured. For example, the user clicking a Button , the app starting are all events. The response of the app to such events are configured by grouping the desired behaviour under the Event block. The methods and property blocks grouped under each event are executed whenever that particular event occurs. Let us take an example. If you want to change the Button text when the user clicks it, you have to group the logic to change the text under the Button.Clicked event. This is shown below. The Event block for changing button text when clicked.

You will be making a simple news application that lists the top 20 news articles trending globally. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Working with APIs and the Web Component Working with the JSON component Working with Dynamic Labels, Buttons, and Images Caution This is guide covers advanced topics like dynamic components and web APIs. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here. First steps \u00b6 We will be using the News API to fetch the trending headlines. Head over to https://newsapi.org/ > to get an API key. Warning You will not be able to monetize apps which use the News API . To place ads in apps that use this API, you will have to switch to their paid plan first. More information is available here The API endpoint we'll be using in this guide is https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?language=en&apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY} This is what a sample response looks like: {\"status\":\"ok\", \"totalResults\":TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_ARTICLES, \"articles\":[ {\"source\": {\"id\":\"SOURCE_ID\",\"name\":\"SOURCE_NAME\"}, \"author\":AUTHOR_NAME, \"title\":\"ARTICLE_TITLE\", \"description\":\"ARTICLE_SUMMARY\", \"urlToImage\":\"ARTICLE_IMAGE\", \"publishedAt\":\"ARTICLE_PUBLISH_DATE\", \"content\":\"ARTICLE_CONTENT\" }, {...} ]} We will need the article title , description , and urlToImage to populate the cards. We'll be using the JSON component to extract data from the API. Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. Drag and drop the Vertical Scroll Arrangement , Web , JSON , Dynamic Label , Dynamic Image , and Dynamic Card View components. Set the Vertical Scroll Arrangement 's height and width designer properties to Fill Parent , and its Align Vertical property to Center . In the Dynamic Card View 's designer properties, set the Corner Radius to 5 and the Elevation to 0. Finally, enable its Full Clickable designer property. Finally, add an Image Utilities component which we will use to load images asynchronously This is what your designer should look like The top 20 news articles will be displayed as Dynamic Card View s, which will be loaded inside the Vertical Scroll Arrangement . Each card will include the article's title, a short description, and a header image. Coding the blocks \u00b6 We will need a variable to store the JSON response from the API. This can be a simple Text variable like so. The API data is to be fetched when the screen initializes. Set the Web component's url to the API url, and perform the GET request. When the Web component has fetched the data, set the response content to the global variable you created. In case there was an issue getting the content, we set the variable to custom error JSON. This is so that the JSON parsing, which has to be done later, doesn't throw errors. Next, we need a procedure that populates the Vertical Scroll Arrangement with cards. This procedure will iterate 20 times if there are more than 20 news articles in the api response variable. If there are less than 20 articles, the procedure will only iterate through the number of articles in the api response. We call this procedure inside the Web component's Got Text block. Next, we create another procedure which takes the JSON object and the array index as parameters. This procedure will create the cards for us and add them to the Vertical Scroll Arrangement . Tip It is recommended you place blocks in procedures so that they are more readable and can be used several times. For each news article, we first create a card view that holds all the content we wish to show. Use the Create Card View block inside the procedure to make a dynamic card for each article. Each card will be 90% of the screen's width and will have automatic height so that it can resize according to the content inside. Next, we create a dynamic image that contains the article's header image. We use the Image Utilities component to load the images asynchronously from the URL, so that the UI doesn't lag while the data is being fetched. Using the Dynamic Label component, we create dynamic labels for each card which contain the article's title. Since this the article's title, we set the font size to 18. Tip It is recommended you set the html parameter to False when getting data from external sources. Unchecked HTML can be used to perform unauthorized actions in your app. We use the Dynamic Label component one more time to create a label for the description. We set the id to a value that we are certain hasn't been used yet. If you are showing the top 200 news articles, then you might want to start your id's from 1000 (or a similarly appropriate number). Finally, we place the procedure call block inside the PopulateNewsArticles procedure. Conclusion \u00b6 The finished project All the blocks we've used Hooray! You've successfully made an app that uses dynamic card views! Here is a summary of what you've learned in this guide. How to create dynamic card views. How to add other dynamic components inside dynamic card views. How to load images asynchronously inside dynamic images. How to decode JSON that is fetched from an API. Next steps \u00b6 Want ideas for making this app better? We have some things for you to try. Open the full article in a web view when the card is clicked. Toggle the visibility of the card's descriptions when they are clicked on. Experiment with different font sizes and typefaces for the title and description. Add more information to each card, like the author's name and the date of publication.

This procedure will iterate 20 times if there are more than 20 news articles in the api response variable. If there are less than 20 articles, the procedure will only iterate through the number of articles in the api response. We call this procedure inside the Web component's Got Text block. Next, we create another procedure which takes the JSON object and the array index as parameters. This procedure will create the cards for us and add them to the Vertical Scroll Arrangement . Tip It is recommended you place blocks in procedures so that they are more readable and can be used several times. For each news article, we first create a card view that holds all the content we wish to show. Use the Create Card View block inside the procedure to make a dynamic card for each article. Each card will be 90% of the screen's width and will have automatic height so that it can resize according to the content inside. Next, we create a dynamic image that contains the article's header image. We use the Image Utilities component to load the images asynchronously from the URL, so that the UI doesn't lag while the data is being fetched. Using the Dynamic Label component, we create dynamic labels for each card which contain the article's title. Since this the article's title, we set the font size to 18. Tip It is recommended you set the html parameter to False when getting data from external sources. Unchecked HTML can be used to perform unauthorized actions in your app. We use the Dynamic Label component one more time to create a label for the description. We set the id to a value that we are certain hasn't been used yet. If you are showing the top 200 news articles, then you might want to start your id's from 1000 (or a similarly appropriate number). Finally, we place the procedure call block inside the PopulateNewsArticles procedure.","title":"Coding the blocks"},{"location":"guides/component-examples/dynamic-cards/#conclusion","text":"The finished project All the blocks we've used Hooray!

Unlike SQL or other conventional database services, Firebase database does not employ a username/password based system to validate modifications to data. Instead, Firebase uses a highly intuitive rules-based system that ensures your data can be used only by those who you authorize. How does it work \u00b6 Firebase Rules are written in JSON and JavaScript. They work alongside Firebase Authentication to restrict read/write access to specific users. It is also possible to validate data before writing it to the database. In this guide, we'll take a look at the different rules one can use to secure their data, and some best practices while writing rules. Use cases for Firebase Rules \u00b6 Testing mode \u00b6 Testing your app is easy when you have full access to your database. To enable read/write access to all tags, use: { \"rules\": { \".read\" : true, \".write\" : true, } } Info All your rules should be wrapped inside the \"rules\" tag. Read rules are always set using the \".read\" tag, and write with \".write\" . The JSON code above specifies two rules for your entire database. Each rule can be thought of as a condition that has to return true if the operation is to succeed. In the case above, both .read and .write always return true , meaning no checks are required before accessing your database. Warning Never set read and write to true in a production environment. Your database can be hacked easily and worse, can be wiped clean by unauthorized users. Authenticated-only mode \u00b6 You can enable only authenticated users to read and write tags in your database. Users can be authenticated using the Firebase Authentication component. { \"rules\": { \".read\" : \"auth.uid != null\", \".write\" : \"auth.uid != null\", } } Every authenticated user has a unique \"uid\". If the uid of the current user is null , then they haven't been authenticated. Such users will not be allowed to read/write data. This is the default Firebase setting. The uid of a user can be accessed from the user ID variable in the Login Success and Current User Success blocks in the Firebase Authentication component. Caution These rules are barely more secure than the testing mode rules. Note that your users can still access all tags and values (including other users' personal data), and can still potentially clear your entire database. Uid-Tag mode \u00b6 You can also write rules to restrict read and write access to specific tags. With such rules, you can ensure that the user can edit only the data which they have created. Considering this database: - users - U43gnonNP9joboLnv - ranking : 1 - email : \"example@example.ex\" - age : 20 - greuo80NOpwqM8100 - ranking : 67 - email : \"something@someone.com\" - age : 15 - kpmkmnn2YIHVI542a - ranking : 2 - email : \"user@product.io\" - age : 45 - challenges - FindingNemo - name : \"Finding Nemo\" - recommended_age: 15 - Marathon - name : \"25mi Marathon\" - recommended_age: 20 The structure of the database is: - users - uid - ranking - email - age - challenges - challengeId - name - recommended_age Every user has their own tag (which is identified by their uid), and each tag contains data about the user. We want users to be able to edit only their data, meaning a user with uid U43gnonNP9joboLnv should be able to edit the ranking, email, and age only for the tag with the name U43gnonNP9joboLnv . However, we wish to let all users see the challenges, but not let anyone edit them (challenges are edited directly from the Firebase console/CLI). Here is how you would write the rules for such a system. Start off with read/write rules for the users tag. { \"rules\" : { \"users\" : { \"$user_id\" : { \".read\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\", \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\" } } } } The $user_id tag is a wildcard reference to all keys that are inside the users tag. We allow read and write operations only if the name of the tag (as specified in $user_id ) equals of the uid of the authenticated user. This way, a user will not be able to access tags that are not theirs as auth.uid will not be the name of the tag. On the other hand, challenges can be read by all and written by none. \"challenges\" : { \".read\" : true, \".write\" : false } The final JSON object will look like { \"rules\" : { \"users\" : { \"$user_id\" : { \".read\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\", \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\" }, \"challenges\" : { \".read\" : true, \".write\" : false } } } } Data validation \u00b6 With Firebase Rules, you can validate user data before it is sent to the database. Firebase provides two variables for this purpose: data and newData . data This variable holds the current value of the database tag. You can use data.val() to fetch the value, or use data.hasChild(child) to check if it has the specified child. Firebase also provides several other functions you can use on your data. More information can be found here newData This variable holds the value the user is attempting to write to the database. newData also supports val , hasChild , and other functions that data has. Best practices \u00b6 Avoid overlap \u00b6 Due to the nature of how Firebase database works, a rule set on a certain tag applies to all of its children. In the example used in Uid-Tag mode , we've set read/write conditions to the \"challenges\" tag. These rules apply to all challenges inside the tag, and to every name and recommended_age inside each challenge. It is not possible to override rules for child tags if a parent tag already has a rule. In essence, Firebase Rules are applied top to bottom. Shallower rules overwrite deeper ones. It is thus advised to structure your database such that you group tags that have similar rules. For example, your database can have two main tags: public and private , and deny read access to all tags inside private . Thus, you will be writing fewer rules and avoiding redundant ones. The more complex your database structure is, the harder it is to write coherent rules that do not have loopholes or security flaws. Avoid unauthenticated access \u00b6 It is always better to set a rule to auth.uid != null instead of true . While both are nearly the same, the former prevents unauthorized users from accessing your data. So in case something goes wrong, you will know for certain that it was one of your authenticated users who caused it. Give limited access \u00b6 Write your rules such that your users can access only that data which they can view. It is not recommended to give your users access to your entire database. Lock access in development \u00b6 Set all rules to false in a development environment where you would not want anyone to edit your database. It is also suggested you lock your database if your product is shutting down. Note You will still be able to access and edit your database either from your Firebase console or from the command-line interface (CLI). Conclusion \u00b6 Firebase Rules are great for securing your database and channeling users to the right tags and values. With the right set of rules, your database will be practically unhackable!

With staged updates, you can control which users see the update based on their country, age, etc., or choose to show updates only to a percentage of your users chosen at random. Staged updates are useful when introducing new features, especially for projects without a dedicated beta testing program. You will be able to gather useful feedback from your random testing group before your release is made available to all. Moreover, you will be able to roll back any \"failed\" updates without causing major issues. Why Firebase Remote Config? \u00b6 Firebase Remote Config lets you enable and disable features to specific users without having them update the app. These features can be both minor (like a new social login provider) and major (like a total redesign of your app). Remote Config is very similar to the OTA update system Android device manufacturers use to update your Android version. You will be making a simple app with a tab layout. Using the Firebase Remote Config component, you will then show a bottom navigation instead of the tab layout to 20% of your users. You will also learn how to release the update to all users, and also to roll-back the changes. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Working with Firebase Working with the Tab Layout and Bottom Navigation components Caution This is guide covers advanced topics like Firebase, staged rollouts, and generic blocks. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here. First steps \u00b6 Head over to your Firebase Console to set up Remote Config for your Firebase project. If you do not have an existing project, create a new one. Use the navigation menu on the left to go to the Remote Config section. Firebase Remote Config works using parameters and values . Your will app will fetch the value of a parameter and then decide how to proceed. Firebase can send different value s to different users, based on some conditions you can set. In this guide, we will create a parameter called bottom_nav_enabled , which returns false for all users except the 20% chosen at random. Give the parameter a name Next, add a condition to your parameter . Every conditon has a name, so that it can be identified easily when several are being used. We will name our condition random_testers_group . There are several constraints to choose from, but for this guide, we will restrict ourselves to \"User in random percentile\". Add a condition Tip It is possible to chain several constraints in a single condition using the \"and\" button. Your parameter can now have two value s: one for those in the random_testers_group , and another for everybody else. Set the value to \"true\" for the testers, and \"false\" for others. Add values to your parameter Finally, click on \"Add parameter\", and then click \"Publish changes\". Publish your changes Warning Publishing your changes will make them live to all your users. Make sure you check everything twice before publishing! That's it for the Firebase part. Now let's move to building your app. Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. Drag and drop the Tab Layout , Bottom Navigation , and Firebase Remote Config components. Also add three Vertical Arrangement components to the Screen . They will function as the different \"sub-views\" of the app which can be accessed using the Tab Layout or Bottom Navigation . Give each Vertical Arrangement a distinct background color, and set their heights and widths to Fill Parent . Ensure only one arrangement is visible at a time, so set the Visible property of two arrangements to False . Finally, set the Visible property of the Bottom Navigation component to False . By default, users will navigate your app using the tab layout. We change this behavior for the random testers group from the Blocks Editor. Warning You will have to upload the google-services.json file to Assets to be able to export your app. This file can be obtained from your Firebase Console. This is what your designer should look like Coding the blocks \u00b6 We first create all the tabs when the screen initializes. In this guide, we have three tabs: Home, Products, and Cart. Next, we handle \"selections\" on the tabs using a procedure which takes the id of the tab as an input. We loop through all the vertical arrangements and set their Visible property to False . Then, we get the selected tab item and its corresponding arrangement, and set its Visible property to True . Generic blocks make it easier to manipulate the visibility of the components, especially in apps with several tabs. We call this procedure from the Tab Layout component's Tab Item Selected event. We do the same for the Bottom Navigation component: first add the menu items (in the Screen's Initialize event), and then handle the selection event. Info The icon assets for the navigation items are provided in the AIA in the Downloads section. We can use the same prodcedure we made for the Tab Layout . Now for the important bit. We use the Firebase Remote Config component to get the visibility status of the Bottom Navigation component. Before we use any of the parameters, we need to fetch all data from Firebase. Place the fetch block in the Screen's Initialize event to do so. Once the data has been fetched, we get the value of the bottom_navigation_enabled parameter. Since this is a boolean parameter, we use the Get Boolean block to retrieve the value. This value can be either True or False , depending on the status of the user. If the user is in the randomly chosen 20% (our random_testers_group ), then True is returned, False otherwise. If the value is True , we show the Bottom Navigation instead of the Tab Layout . Note Updates to parameters can take a few hours to update across all devices, so don't be alarmed if you don't see all changes immediately. Conclusion \u00b6 What a regular user sees (left) vs what a randomly chosen beta tester sees (right) All the blocks we've used in this guide Releasing the update to everyone \u00b6 To release the changes to all your users, simply go to your Firebase Console and remove the condition from the parameter so that it always returns true. Setting the parameter to true by default Rolling back updates \u00b6 To roll back the update you've made, remove the condition from the parameter and set the default value to false. This ensures nobody sees the Bottom Navigation anymore. Removing the condition so that the parameter always returns false Congratulations! You've successfully learnt to stage your app updates and release features to select users! Here is a summary of what you've learned in this guide. How to set up Remote Config in Firebase. How to show features only to a few users. How to create a simple screen with a Tab Layout and a Bottom Navigation. How to fetch the Remote Config parameters. How to use the fetched data to change the layout of your app during runtime. Next steps \u00b6 Want ideas for making this app better? We have some things for you to try. Add more constraints to your condition. For example, show the Bottom Navigation to 20% of your users from the USA. Create more parameters and values. Add language based constraints. For instance, show a link to a German-English dictionary in your app if the user is from Germany. Roll back features and release them to all your users. Add a feedback form to your app so that users can share their thoughts on the Bottom Navigation . Ensure that the feedback form is shown only to users who see the Bottom Navigation !

Rules are a JSON and JavaScript based system that allow you to restrict database access to certain tags and/or users. You will be making a simple app that lets users sign in with Firebase Authentication and saves their data in the real-time database. Then, you will write some rules to prevent others from accessing sensitive user data. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Working with Firebase Database and Authentication Working with Firebase Rules Caution This is guide covers advanced Firebase topics. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here. Take a look at our guide on working with Firebase Rules for an introduction to the rules system. First steps \u00b6 Head over to your Firebase Console to set up a real-time database for your Firebase project. If you do not have an existing project, create a new one. Use the navigation menu on the left to go to the Database section. In case the real-time database has not been enabled already, scroll to the bottom and click on \"Realtime database\". You will be using Google login for user authentication. Go to the Authentication section using the menu on the left, and enable Google as an authentication provider. More details on Google authentication can be found here . Enable Google login Database structure \u00b6 For this tutorial, we will store a tag for each user who signs-up in the app. The tag will be identified by the user's unique id, and will contain their name, email, and the Android version of their device. We wish to keep the users' names public, but their email and Android version private. Here is what our database will look like: - bucket_name - uid - name - email - android_version - uids uids will be an array of all unique ids that are in the database. We will use this tag later to iterate through all users and get their names. That's all the Firebase for now. Let's move to building your app. We'll come back to the Firebase console later to write the rules. Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. We will need three buttons for this project - one to sign the user in, another to send their details to the database, and one more to fetch the names of all users in the database. Drag and drop three Button components and name them SignInButton , UpdateDetailsButton , and GetDetailsButton . Next, drop a Text Box where the user will be able to enter their name. Then, add a Notifier component and rename it to MessageNotifier . We will use this component to display the names of all users. Finally, drop the Firebase Database , Firebase Authentication , and Device Utilities components. The Device Utilities component will be used to fetch the Android version of the user's device. Warning You will have to upload the google-services.json file to Assets to be able to export your app. This file can be obtained from your Firebase Console. This is what your designer should look like Tip The components shown above have been styled with colors and borders to make them look better. Download AIA from the bottom of the page to use them in your app! Coding the blocks \u00b6 First, we add an event block to handle clicks on the SignInButton . The user is to be shown a prompt to sign in with Google. Once the login is successful, we append the user's unique id to the uids tag in the database. Next, we handle clicks on the UpdateDetailsButton . When the button is clicked, we first fetch the user's details so that we can get their uid. Then, using the uid, we update their name, email, and Android version. Note As of now, a user can fetch the list of all uids and update the details of any other user. We will be writing Firebase rules later to ensure the data a user can edit is limited to their uid. Finally, we code the recursive function to get the names of all the users. Note that we cannot use the Get Tag List block as the rules we will be writing will block direct access to these tags. To get the names of all the users, we will need two lists: one for all uids and another for all names. We initiate the recursion using the Click event block for the GetDetailsButton . When the value has been fetched, we populate the list of uids, and then fetch the name of the first uid in the list. We do the same for each uid in the list. Every time we fetch the name of the uid, we remove the uid from the list and add the name to the names list. Once all names have been fetched, we show them in a message dialog. Writing the rules \u00b6 Head back to your Firebase console. In the Realtime Database section, navigate to the \"rules\" tab. By default, Firebase allows full read/write access. If you created your database in locked mode, the default rules will allow only authenticated users, and your rules will look something like: { \"rules\": { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"auth != null\", } } Neither of them are secure because all your users have access to all data in your database. Let's fix this with a few rules. To start off, replace the currently set rules with a blank template as shown below: { \"rules\" : { } } Next, change the rules as shown to target all tags in your project bucket. Replace *PROJECT_BUCKET* with your bucket name. (The bucket name can be found in the designer properties of the Firebase Database component). { \"rules\": { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\": { //... to be added later } } } Rules for users' details \u00b6 We wish for a user to be able to edit only their details. Each user has a tag for themselves, which is named as their uid. Thus, a user should only be able to edit the tag which belongs to them. We can use wildcard keys to select any tag inside your project bucket, as shown below: { \"rules\" : { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\" : { \"$uid\" : { } } } } A user should be able to edit only their name and nobody else's, but all authenticated users should be able to view every user's name. We can restrict read/write operations accordingly with this rule: \"name\": { \".read\": \"auth != null\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } However, the email and Android version should have restricted read and write access. \"email\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"android_version\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } Our list of rules currently looks like this: { \"rules\": { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\": { \"$uid\": { \"name\": { \".read\": \"auth != null\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"email\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"android_version\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } } } } } Let's take an example of a sample database to see how the rules work. The database currently has the following data: { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\" : { \"163IN5WF62eJsFeYQMmFdIIcAvl2\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"8.1.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"vishwas@kodular.io\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Vishwas\\\"\" }, \"AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"9.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"helios@helios.com\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Helios\\\"\" }, \"KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"8.1.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"vishwasadiga@gmail.com\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Mr. Example\\\"\" }, \"uids\" : \"[\\\"AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1\\\", \\\"163IN5WF62eJsFeYQMmFdIIcAvl2\\\", \\\"KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62\\\"]\" } } A user currently authenticated with the uid AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1 is able to fetch their own name, email, and Android version: The user is also able to edit the value of their name, email, and Android version. In addition, the user can access the names of other users, say, one with the uid KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62 . But they cannot get the email or Android version of other users. Nor can they set the name, email, or Android version of other users. Rules for list of uids \u00b6 Every user should be able to access the list of all uids, but should not be allowed to spam the list with random values. We can validate the data to ensure the user is appending their uid to the list, and not any other value. Validation can be done using the following rule: \"uids\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists()\" } With the rule set, all authenticated users will be able to read the value of the uids list. An authenticated user can also append their uid to the list. However, no other value except the user's uid can be entered. In essence, the newData variable must have a child that is the user's uid, which guarantees that the appended list has the correct uid. The current implementation, however, adds the user's unique id to the list every time they login. To keep only unique values of the uid, we prevent users from writing duplicates. The .write rule can be changed from \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists()\" to \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists() && !data.child(auth.uid).exists()\" This ensures that the uid is written only if the current data doesn't already contain it. Let's illustrate with the example of a user with the uid AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1 . The user can append their uid to the list of all uids But cannot append anything other than their uid Our final list of rules looks like this: { \"rules\" : { \"firebase_auth\" : { \"$uid\" : { \"name\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\" , \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $uid\" } , \"email\" : { \".read\" : \"auth.uid == $uid\" , \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $uid\" } , \"android_version\" : { \".read\" : \"auth.uid == $uid\" , \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $uid\" } } , \"uids\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\" , \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists() && !data.child(auth.uid).exists()\" } } } } Conclusion \u00b6 All the blocks we've used in this guide Congratulations!
